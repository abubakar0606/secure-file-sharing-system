
Secure File Sharing System




1. Secure File Sharing

Secure file sharing is the procedure of sharing files in a secure manner so that
only authorized users can access them. It helps protect sensitive information
from unauthorized access, data leaks, or interception during file transfer.

2. End-to-End Encryption 

End-to-End Encryption is the practice of encrypting a file before uploading it and
can only be decrypted by the intended receiver. Even the cloud storage provider
cannot read the file content because it remains encrypted during storage and transfer.

3. Cloud Storage

Cloud storage is utilized for storing files on remote servers instead of local computers.
It offers scalability, availability, and secure remote access to files.
Examples include AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage.

4. Signed URLs

A signed URL is a temporary and secure link that gives access to a private file stored in the cloud. The link expires after a certain time, ensuring controlled and providing secure access to files without making the file public. Conclusion: Secure file sharing integrates encryption, cloud storage, and signed URLs to provide that files are shared in a safe manner and can only be accessed by authorized users.
